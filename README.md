# allchat
A new take on a real time chat-room application.

## instructions
Once you open the site you are brought to the home page, where a user can log in and after they log in, they are brought to the main room, however from the main room, the user can choose to go to other rooms, based off of different topics. (think reddit)
## main room
Each room will have a virtual environment for the users to live-chat about a topic, while also discussing topics posted within the room
